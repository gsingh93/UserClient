Application Flow:
BusClient - Updates server with Long/Lat corresponding to route name
	If route.name == routename;
		Post URL
Server - Calculates times and distances for each stop
Server - Updates coord.xml
	PHP: Write changes
UserClient - Polls server for information for all routes
		If route.name == routename;
			Change Map Pos.
			

4. Retrieve bus info at regular intervals
5. Have server calculate arrival distance/time and send to UserClient

At this point, all that remains is to design the UserClient UI
