Figure out the text view properties
Understand ExpandableListView

Application Flow:
BusClient - Updates server with Long/Lat corresponding to route name
	If route.name == routename;
		Post URL
Server - Calculates times and distances for each stop
Server - Updates coord.xml
	PHP: Write changes
UserClient - Polls server for information for all routes
		If route.name == routename;
			Change Map Pos.

1. Add little popup when stop clicked
2. Add Stop List/Route List page
	Route List will display stops under route with time/distance information.
	Clicking on stop will go to stop on map
	Stop List will display buses that go to stop with time/distance information.
	Clicking on stop will go to stop
	Add filters/sorting
4. Retrieve bus info at regular intervals
5. Have server calculate arrival distance/time and send to UserClient
6. Change GET to POST
7. Add Route/Stop has been changed feature
8. Add multiple threads
9. Power management/location accuracy

At this point, all that remains is to design the UserClient UI
