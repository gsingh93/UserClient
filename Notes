Application Flow:
BusClient - Updates server with Long/Lat corresponding to route name
	If route.name == routename;
		Post URL
Server - Calculates times and distances for each stop
Server - Updates coord.xml
	PHP: Write changes
UserClient - Polls server for information for all routes
		If route.name == routename;
			Change Map Pos.
			
TODO:
1. Successfully retreive bus (user) location from server
2. Separate UserClient and BusClient
3. Initialize buses from XML data

At this point, the BusClient app should upload it's data (including new bus data)
to the server and the server should format it into proper XML. The user can see
his location on the UserClient app, as well as the locations of each registered
bus. 

4. Retreive bus info at regular intervals
5. Have server calculate arrival distance/time and send to UserClient

At this point, all that remains is to design the UserClient UI
