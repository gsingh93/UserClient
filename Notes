Application Flow:
BusClient - Updates server with Long/Lat corresponding to route name
	If route.name == routename;
		Post URL

Server - Updates coord.xml
	PHP: Write changes
UserClient - Polls server for information for all routes
		If route.name == routename;
			Change Map Pos.

0. Add little popup when stop clicked
1. Add menu
2. Add Stop List/Route List page
3. Add <bus> tag to xml and parsing to code
4. Retrieve bus info at regular intervals
5. Have server calculate arrival distance/time and send to UserClient
6. Change GET to POST
7. Add Route/Stop has been changed feature
8. Add multiple threads
9. Power management/location accuracy

At this point, all that remains is to design the UserClient UI
