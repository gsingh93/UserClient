Figure out the text view properties

Application Flow:
BusClient - Updates server with Long/Lat corresponding to route name
	If route.name == routename;
		Post URL
Server - Calculates times and distances for each stop
Server - Updates coord.xml
	PHP: Write changes
UserClient - Polls server for information for all routes
		If route.name == routename;
			Change Map Pos.
			
BusOverlay displays popup with bus information on tap
StopsOverlay displays stop name on tap
Bus contains all stops? What about route list?


4. Retrieve bus info at regular intervals
5. Have server calculate arrival distance/time and send to UserClient
6. Change GET to POST
7. Add Route/Stop has been changed feature
8. Add multiple threads
9. Power management/location accuracy

At this point, all that remains is to design the UserClient UI
